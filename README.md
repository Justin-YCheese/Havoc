# Havoc
A card game by Justin and Brandon

## Introduction
  Havoc is a quick competitive card game in which the player with the most points wins. Each game is played with several rounds that have multiple phases. Cards have different points values, power values, and abilities. The players play cards from their hand and draw cards from the deck, and generally the player who plays cards with more power wins.

  I'm making a version of this card game in tabletop simulator in the steam workshop, but it is not currently public. I'm using this GitHub repository to easily transfer code changes between contributors.
